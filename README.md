## Project description
<p align="center">We have to create a website where you are able to view assets and see if those assets will be working when a dike collapses. http://vitale-assets.herokuapp.com/. This project is currently in progress. The current project is being built in a private repository. I do not want to make this public, since there might be sensitive data, but it is really worth a share.</p>
